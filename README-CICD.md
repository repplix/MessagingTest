# CI/CD process 

This README provides a guideline how to set up and use a CI/CD pipeline based on GitHub actions.

Within the context of this template, CI/CD means: 
*   __Continuous Integration:__ Refers to automatic build, test and merge process. The merge process is only automated for dependency updates of patch and minor versions. 
*   __Continuous Delivery:__ Refers to automatically tag and release a version to a repository. This means building a new docker image and uploaded it to [GitHub Container Registry](https://ghcr.io).

To avoid misunderstandings we do not abbreviate the term __continuous deployment__ which in this context describes the automatic deployment into production.  

## Set up your CI/CD Process

*   Make your repository public to use ghcr or ensure that you have billing plan including access to ghcr.
  
*   Setup action secret for auto merge version updates from dependabot:

    *   Create a personal access token (PAT) in developer settings, as described [here](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token) with `public_repo` access enabled.

    *   Set up a secret for GitHub actions called `MERGE_ME_SECRET` for the new repository as described [here](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/encrypted-secrets?tool=webui#creating-encrypted-secrets-for-a-repository) that includes the generated PAT

*   To build a new release via GitHub actions enable write access for the  `GITHUB_TOKEN` as described [here](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/enabling-features-for-your-repository/managing-github-actions-settings-for-a-repository#configuring-the-default-github_token-permissions).


## Using CI/CD process

The CI/CD process is based on following GitHub actions that are either started manually or automatically. To validate your CI/CD settings start all actions with start option manually:  

*   [mavenBuild.yml](.github/workflows/mavenBuild.yml):
    *   __Description:__ Builds the project after each push
    *   __Started:__ Automatically and manually   

*   [newRelease.yml](.github/workflows/newRelease.yml):
    *   __Description:__ Create a new release using maven via GitHub web page
    *   __Started:__ Manually only
    *   Please note that the first run fails, because the link to the ghcr.io repository is automatically created, first time you try to access it. So, please run this action twice, as soon as you created the repo.


*   [autoMerge.yml](.github/workflows/autoMerge.yml):
    *   __Description:__ Automatic merge of dependency updates with new patch or minor versions of dependencies from Dependabot. See https://github.com/ridedott/merge-me-action for more information.
    *   __Started:__ Automatically only

*   [dependabot.yml](.github/dependabot.yml):
    *   __Description:__ Check for new dependencies and create a pull request
    *   __Started:__ Automatically only (each day)
  
## Deployment 

In the following we assume a docker-swarm setup which is a typical starting point for clustering your container.
In addition, it can be easily run and maintained on your developing machine. 

### Docker-Stacks

*   [developerStack.yml](deploy/developerStack.yml)
    *   Includes all required dependencies to run the application during development on your local machine

*   [docker-compose.yml](deploy/docker-compose.yml)
    *   Stack to run the application as stack in your production environment

### Deploy Stack 

In order to deploy the stack, you can use following command from your checkout directory. 
```shell
docker stack deploy --compose-file ./deploy/docker-compose.yml jexxatemplate
```

### Continuous Deployment 

If you want start using continuous deployment mechanism which automatically deploys new versions into
production, we recommend to start using some tools such as [Portainer](https://www.portainer.io). This 
container management platform provides unified frontend to docker, docker-swarm and kubernetes. Therefore, 
it is a good starting point.

In this file, we highlight only the following two aspects:

* **Zero downtime deployment:** For zero downtime deployment we configure rolling updates for the application as you can see
  in the [docker-compose.yml](deploy/docker-compose.yml). The most interesting part here are the following lines:
  ```yml  
  healthcheck:
     test: ["CMD-SHELL", "wget -nv -t1 --spider 'http://localhost:7500/BoundedContext/isRunning/'"]`
  ```
  The return value of this call is only true, if the application could be successfully started. This also includes all
  connections to infrastructure components, such as requesting a REST port, or setting-up a connection to a database. In  
  case of a rolling update, a new release is only deployed, if this method returns true within the defined period of time.
  If this call fails, the old version remains active.

* **Handling of secrets:** In general, Jexxa provides dedicated properties to read credentials from a file as described
  [here](https://jexxa-projects.github.io/Jexxa/jexxa_reference.html#_secrets). This allows you to dynamically hand in credentials such as a keystore, or a password into a container as files. For local development, you can define some dummy secrets in [jexxa-test.properties](src/test) such as a self-signed certificate. For simplicity reason we define the remaining secrets directly in jexxa-application.properties which is not recommended for production use.
